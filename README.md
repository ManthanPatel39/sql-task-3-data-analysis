# sql-task-3-data-analysis
This task is part of a data analyst internship project. The goal was to use SQL to analyze an e-commerce dataset.

I used MySQL Workbench and a dataset called data-2.csv, which contains customer transactions. I created SQL queries to filter data, calculate totals, and analyze customer and product behavior.

I also created a new table called products to practice JOINs and linked it with the main transaction data. Other SQL concepts used include GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, views, and indexes.

Files included:

ecommerce_analysis.sql – contains all the queries

products_create.sql – SQL code to create and fill the products table

SQL_Task_3_Screenshots(output).pdf – screenshots of the query outputs
